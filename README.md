# ARM
By: Ash Robbins

Deep reinforcement learning algorithms applied to my biological robotic arm. Also an environment for the real world/simulation.

# Tasks:

X Create an elbow joint for the arm
Analyze motion of the arm through experiments for the spring constants and more
Analyze motion by analysis of long-term experiments using NN
~ Simulate using OpenSim or MuJoCo

X Create QLearning Agent
X Create Arm testing environment
X Analyze data of learning over time
X Monitor external disturbances

X Create DeepQLearning Agent
X Create generalized environment for the newer robotic arm(Discrete and Continuous)
~ Learn to control to a single trajectory
~ Analyze learning with different hyper-parameters, elbow joints, and more


~ Create DDPG Agent
Create an exploration function for training
Learn to control to a goal state
Learn how to do patterns of movement(sin wave/ other)
Analyze ability to generate correct output

Create a shoulder joint
